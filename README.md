fake version of nvml
====================

This is a fork of the NVML repo to play around with a fake
pmemblk implementation (one that skips all the BTT stuff
for benchmarking).

None of this should be used for anything you care about at this point.

See https://github.com/pmem/nvml for the actual NVM Library.
