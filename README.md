fake version of nvml
====================

This is a fork of the NVML repo to play around with
API ideas for the transactional API for Persistent Memory.

I'm currently playing on the **faketrn** branch, in the files
src/include/libpmem.h, src/trn.[ch], and src/test.

None of this should be used for anything you care about at this point.

See https://github.com/pmem/nvml for the actual NVM Library.
