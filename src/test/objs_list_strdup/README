This is src/test/objs_list_strdup/README.

This directory contains a simple linked list test for pmemobjs.

Run:
	objs_list_strdup file [string...]

to access a pmemobjs linked list data structure in the given file.
Any values provided should be strings which will be added to the
list.  The special strings "f" is used to free the entire list at that
point and continue from there with an empty list.  The program
prints the current list before exiting.
