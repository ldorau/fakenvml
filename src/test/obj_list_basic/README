This is src/test/obj_list_basic/README.

This directory contains a simple linked list test for pmemobj.

Run:
	obj_list_basic file [val...]

to access a pmemobj linked list data structure in the given file.
Any values provided should be integers which will be added to the
list.  The special val "f" is used to free the entire list at that
point and continue from there with an empty list.  The program
prints the current list before exiting.
